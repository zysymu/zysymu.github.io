Clues to the identity of dark matter have remained surprisingly elusive, given the scope of experimental programs aimed at its identification. While terrestrial experiments may be able to nail down a model, an alternative, and equally promising, method is to identify dark matter based on astrophysical or cosmological signatures. A particularly sensitive approach is based on the unique signature of dark matter substructure on galaxy-galaxy strong lensing images. Machine learning applications have been explored in detail for extracting just this signal. With limited availability of high quality strong lensing data, these approaches have exclusively relied on simulations. Naturally, due to the differences with the real instrumental data, machine learning models trained on simulations are expected to lose accuracy when applied to real data. This is where domain adaptation can serve as a crucial bridge between simulations and real data applications. In this work, we demonstrate the power of domain adaptation techniques applied to strong gravitational lensing data with dark matter substructure. We show with simulated data sets of varying complexity, that domain adaptation can significantly mitigate the losses in the model performance. This technique can help domain experts build and apply better machine learning models for extracting useful information from strong gravitational lensing data expected from the upcoming surveys.
